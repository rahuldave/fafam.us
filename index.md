# Fafam

**One event. Everyone's photos. All in one place.**

Fafam is a private photo sharing app for real-life moments. Create an event, invite your people, and everyone uploads their photos to the same gallery. No accounts to manage, no social media, no algorithms. Just the photos that matter, from the people who were there.

## What it's for

### Weddings and celebrations

The best wedding photos aren't always from the photographer. Your cousin caught the flower girl mid-laugh. Your college roommate got the candid toast reaction. Grandma took a blurry but irreplaceable shot of three generations together. Fafam collects all of those into one gallery, sorted by when they were taken, so you get the full story of the day from every angle.

### Family gatherings

Thanksgiving, reunions, birthday parties, holiday dinners. Everyone takes photos on their own phone and they stay there. With Fafam, the host creates an event, shares a link, and suddenly you have Uncle Mike's backyard shots alongside the kids' table chaos alongside the group photo someone remembered to take. No group chat with 47 unrelated messages to scroll past.

### Trips with friends

A weekend cabin trip. A beach day. A road trip. Everyone shoots different things. Fafam gives the group a shared album that builds itself as the trip unfolds. Open the app, upload what you've got, browse what everyone else saw.

### Work and teams

An offsite, a conference, a product launch, a team dinner. Someone always ends up being the "can you send me that photo" person. Instead: one event link in Slack, everyone uploads, done. Also useful for sharing photos of whiteboards, signage, or anything the team needs to reference later.

### Everyday sharing

A playdate at the park. A neighborhood block party. A pickup basketball game. Not everything needs a wedding-level event — sometimes you just want to swap photos with three people without creating a group chat or posting publicly.

## How it works

### Getting an invite

Fafam is invite-only. You get in one of two ways:

Someone gives you an **invite link** — a URL like `withme.you/i/FAMILY` — that lets you create an account. You enter your phone number, verify with a one-time code sent via text, pick a username, and you're in. From there you can create your own events and invite others.

Or someone shares an **event link** with you — a URL like `withme.you/e/Xk9mQw` — and you sign up right there. You'll land directly in their event after verifying your phone. You can view and upload photos immediately.

Either way, there's no password to remember. When you come back, you sign in with your username and verify with a text code. That's it.

### Hosting an event

Anyone with an account can create an event. Tap "Create Event" on the home page, give it a name, and you're the host. You'll get:

- A **join link** you can text, email, or drop in a group chat
- A **QR code** you can show in person (great for weddings — print it on a table card)
- An **event code** people can type in manually

Share any of these and people can join. As host, you upload photos like everyone else — your photos appear in the gallery immediately since you're automatically trusted.

You can also make your event **public**, which means anyone can view the gallery from your profile page at `username.withme.you` without needing an account. They can browse and see every photo, but they can't upload or interact — it's read-only. Useful for sharing wedding galleries or trip photos with people who weren't there. Toggle it on or off anytime from the event page.

### Moderation

As host, you're responsible for keeping the gallery clean. Fafam gives you a moderation panel where you can:

- **Approve or remove photos** — new uploaders' photos start as "pending" until you trust them. You review and decide what makes it into the gallery.
- **Trust members** — once you trust someone, all their future uploads go straight to the gallery without review.
- **Block or kick members** — remove someone who's uploading junk, or block them from uploading entirely.
- **Rotate the join code** — if the join link gets shared too widely, rotate it. Old links stop working, you share a new one with only the people you want.

If you don't moderate, things still work — the community can report photos (two reports auto-hides a photo), and trusted members' uploads appear immediately. But for events with kids or family, active moderation keeps things comfortable for everyone.

### Joining an event

Someone sends you a link. You tap it. If you already have an account, you land in the event and can start uploading. If you're new, you sign up right there — phone number, text code, pick a username — and you're in the event within a minute.

Once you're in, you see the full gallery of everyone's photos, sorted by when they were actually taken (not when they were uploaded). Tap any photo to view it full-size, swipe through the gallery, and add captions. To contribute, tap "Add Photos," pick from your camera roll, and they upload in the background. Your photos appear in the gallery once processed.

You can join as many events as you like. They all show up on your home page.

## Privacy

Fafam is built for private sharing by default:

- Events are **private** unless the host explicitly makes them public
- Your **profile page** only shows public events — nothing else is visible to the outside world
- There is no feed, no discovery, no recommendations — you only see events you've been invited to
- Photos are stored in cloud storage with access-controlled URLs that expire
- No data is sold or used for advertising

The audience is everyone from a 90-year-old grandparent to a teenager. The design prioritizes simplicity, large text, and high contrast so that nobody needs help using it.
