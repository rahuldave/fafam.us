# Fafam

**One event. Everyone's photos. All in one place.**

Fafam is a private photo sharing app for real-life moments. Create an event, invite your people, and everyone uploads their photos to the same gallery. No accounts to manage, no social media, no algorithms. Just the photos that matter, from the people who were there.

## What it's for

### Weddings and celebrations

The best wedding photos aren't always from the photographer. Your cousin caught the flower girl mid-laugh. Your college roommate got the candid toast reaction. Grandma took a blurry but irreplaceable shot of three generations together. Fafam collects all of those into one gallery, sorted by when they were taken, so you get the full story of the day from every angle.

### Family gatherings

Thanksgiving, reunions, birthday parties, holiday dinners. Everyone takes photos on their own phone and they stay there. With Fafam, the host creates an event, shares a link, and suddenly you have Uncle Mike's backyard shots alongside the kids' table chaos alongside the group photo someone remembered to take. No group chat with 47 unrelated messages to scroll past.

### Trips with friends

A weekend cabin trip. A beach day. A road trip. Everyone shoots different things. Fafam gives the group a shared album that builds itself as the trip unfolds. Open the app, upload what you've got, browse what everyone else saw.

### Work and teams

An offsite, a conference, a product launch, a team dinner. Someone always ends up being the "can you send me that photo" person. Instead: one event link in Slack, everyone uploads, done. Also useful for sharing photos of whiteboards, signage, or anything the team needs to reference later.

### Everyday sharing

A playdate at the park. A neighborhood block party. A pickup basketball game. Not everything needs a wedding-level event — sometimes you just want to swap photos with three people without creating a group chat or posting publicly.

## Signing in

### Getting an invite

Fafam is invite-only. You get in one of two ways:

Someone gives you an **invite link** — a URL like `withme.you/i/FAMILY` — that lets you create an account. You enter your phone number, verify with a one-time code sent via text, pick a username, and you're in. From there you can create your own events and invite others.

Or someone shares an **event link** with you — a URL like `withme.you/e/Xk9mQw` — and you sign up right there. After verifying your phone and picking a username, you're taken straight to the event's join page. Tap "Join Event" and you can view and upload photos immediately.

Either way, there's no password to remember. When you come back, you sign in with your username and verify with a text code. That's it.

### Returning users

If you already have an account, go to [withme.you](https://withme.you) and sign in with your username. We'll text a one-time code to the phone number on file. Enter the code and you're in — straight to your home page with all your events.

### Your profile

Every user has a public profile page at `username.withme.you`. If you've made any of your events public, they'll be listed there — anyone can browse those galleries without needing an account. If none of your events are public, your profile just shows your name and username.

Your profile is how other people discover your shared albums. When someone views an event's member list, each name links to that person's profile. From there they can tap into any public event to browse the gallery.

If you visit your own profile page, you'll be redirected to your home page instead.

### Privacy

Fafam is built for private sharing by default:

- Events are **private** unless the host explicitly makes them public
- Your **profile page** only shows public events — nothing else is visible to the outside world
- There is no feed, no discovery, no recommendations — you only see events you've been invited to
- Photos are stored in cloud storage with access-controlled URLs that expire
- No data is sold or used for advertising

The audience is everyone from a 90-year-old grandparent to a teenager. The design prioritizes simplicity, large text, and high contrast so that nobody needs help using it.
