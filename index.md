# Fafam

**One event. Everyone's photos. All in one place.**

Fafam is a private photo sharing app for real-life moments. Create an event, invite your people, and everyone uploads their photos to the same gallery. No accounts to manage, no social media, no algorithms. Just the photos that matter, from the people who were there.

## What it's for

### Weddings and celebrations

The best wedding photos aren't always from the photographer. Your cousin caught the flower girl mid-laugh. Your college roommate got the candid toast reaction. Grandma took a blurry but irreplaceable shot of three generations together. Fafam collects all of those into one gallery, sorted by when they were taken, so you get the full story of the day from every angle.

### Family gatherings

Thanksgiving, reunions, birthday parties, holiday dinners. Everyone takes photos on their own phone and they stay there. With Fafam, the host creates an event, shares a link, and suddenly you have Uncle Mike's backyard shots alongside the kids' table chaos alongside the group photo someone remembered to take. No group chat with 47 unrelated messages to scroll past.

### Trips with friends

A weekend cabin trip. A beach day. A road trip. Everyone shoots different things. Fafam gives the group a shared album that builds itself as the trip unfolds. Open the app, upload what you've got, browse what everyone else saw.

### Work and teams

An offsite, a conference, a product launch, a team dinner. Someone always ends up being the "can you send me that photo" person. Instead: one event link in Slack, everyone uploads, done. Also useful for sharing photos of whiteboards, signage, or anything the team needs to reference later.

### Everyday sharing

A playdate at the park. A neighborhood block party. A pickup basketball game. Not everything needs a wedding-level event — sometimes you just want to swap photos with three people without creating a group chat or posting publicly.

## How it works

### Getting an invite

Fafam is invite-only. You get in one of two ways:

Someone gives you an **invite link** — a URL like `withme.you/i/FAMILY` — that lets you create an account. You enter your phone number, verify with a one-time code sent via text, pick a username, and you're in. From there you can create your own events and invite others.

Or someone shares an **event link** with you — a URL like `withme.you/e/Xk9mQw` — and you sign up right there. You'll land directly in their event after verifying your phone. You can view and upload photos immediately.

Either way, there's no password to remember. When you come back, you sign in with your username and verify with a text code. That's it.

### Hosting an event

Anyone with an account can create an event. Tap "Create Event" on the home page, give it a name, and optionally add a short description — a tagline, a vibe, whatever you want. You'll get:

- A **join link** you can text, email, or drop in a group chat
- A **QR code** you can show in person (great for weddings — print it on a table card)
- An **event code** people can type in manually

Share any of these and people can join. As host, you upload photos like everyone else — your photos appear in the gallery immediately since you're automatically trusted.

The description is optional and can be added or changed anytime from the event page — tap the pencil icon or the "+ Add a description…" link below the event name. It shows up on your home page, the event page, and on your public profile if the event is public. Keep it short — 300 characters max.

You can also set an **event date** — the date and time the event takes place. This is optional. If you set it, the event sorts by that date on your home page and profile, and it displays on the event page. If you leave it empty, the event uses the date of the most recent photo instead, which is usually what you want. You can set, change, or clear the event date anytime from the event page.

You can also make your event **public**, which means anyone can view the gallery from your profile page at `username.withme.you` without needing an account. They can browse and see every photo, but they can't upload or interact — it's read-only. Useful for sharing wedding galleries or trip photos with people who weren't there. Toggle it on or off anytime from the event page.

### Moderation

As host, you're responsible for keeping the gallery clean. Fafam gives you a moderation panel where you can:

- **Approve or remove photos** — new uploaders' photos start as "pending" until you trust them. You review and decide what makes it into the gallery.
- **Trust members** — once you trust someone, all their future uploads go straight to the gallery without review.
- **Block or kick members** — remove someone who's uploading junk, or block them from uploading entirely.
- **Rotate the join code** — if the join link gets shared too widely, rotate it. Old links stop working, you share a new one with only the people you want.

If you don't moderate, things still work — the community can report photos (two reports auto-hides a photo), and trusted members' uploads appear immediately. But for events with kids or family, active moderation keeps things comfortable for everyone.

### Photo dates

Photos in the gallery are sorted by when they were taken, using the date embedded in the image file (EXIF data). Most phone cameras include this automatically. If a photo has no EXIF date — screenshots, downloaded images, scanned photos — it falls back to the upload date.

You can override the date on any photo you uploaded, or on any photo in an event you host. Tap the pencil icon next to the date below the photo, pick a new date and time, and hit Save. The gallery re-sorts to reflect the change, and the event's "latest photo" date updates too.

To revert to the original date, tap the pencil again and hit Clear. If the photo had EXIF data, it goes back to that. If not, it goes back to the upload date. The hint below the date picker tells you which one it'll use. You can also hit Cancel to close the picker without making any changes.

This is useful for:
- **Screenshots or saved images** that show today's date instead of when the moment actually happened
- **Scanned prints** where you want the gallery to reflect the original date
- **Correcting wrong dates** from cameras with misconfigured clocks

### Event dates

By default, an event's date on the home page and profile is determined automatically — it shows the date of the most recent photo in the event. This usually works well: a wedding event shows the wedding date, a trip event shows the last day of the trip.

If you want to set a specific date — for a future event, or to override the computed date — tap "+ Set event date" on the event page (visible to hosts only, below the description). Pick a date and time, hit Save. The event now sorts by that date on your home page and public profile.

The date picker shows the current "latest photo" date in the hint text so you know what you're overriding. To go back to automatic dating, tap the pencil icon next to the event date and hit Clear. To close without changes, hit Cancel.

Setting an event date is optional and subtly discouraged — the automatic behavior is usually better. But it's there when you need it.

### Reporting photos

If you see a photo that shouldn't be in the gallery, tap on it and hit "Report photo" at the bottom. You'll be asked to confirm, and once you do, the photo is flagged. If two different members report the same photo, it's automatically hidden from the gallery until the host reviews it. You can only report a photo once — after that, the button shows "Reported."

Reporting is anonymous to other members. Only the host can see reported photos in the moderation panel and decide whether to keep or remove them.

### Deleting photos

The host can delete any photo from their event. Open the photo, scroll down, and tap "Delete photo." The photo and all its copies (thumbnail, medium, original) are permanently removed from storage. This cannot be undone.

If you uploaded a photo and it hasn't been approved yet (still "pending"), you can also delete it yourself. Once a photo has been approved and is visible in the gallery, only the host can delete it.

### Deleting an event

The host can delete an entire event from the event page. Scroll to the very bottom and tap "Delete event." This permanently removes everything: all photos (from storage and the database), all member associations, and the event itself. Every photo's original, thumbnail, and medium-size copy is deleted from cloud storage. The members' accounts are not affected — they just won't see the event on their home page anymore.

This cannot be undone. You'll be asked to confirm before anything is deleted.

### Deleting your account

You can delete your account from the Settings page. Scroll past "Sign out" and tap "Delete my account." Here's what happens:

- **Events you host** are entirely deleted — all photos (from cloud storage and the database), members, and the event itself. Gone.
- **Photos you uploaded to other people's events** that are still pending review are deleted. Photos that were already approved stay — they belong to the event now, and the host keeps them.
- **Your memberships** in other events are removed.
- **Your account** is marked as deleted. Your username stays reserved so nobody else can take it.
- **You're logged out** immediately.

If you change your mind, you can log back in with the same phone number. Your account is restored — username, display name, everything. But your hosted events and their photos are gone permanently. Deletion of content is irreversible; only the account itself can be recovered.

### Joining an event

Someone sends you a link. You tap it. If you already have an account, you land in the event and can start uploading. If you're new, you sign up right there — phone number, text code, pick a username — and you're in the event within a minute.

Once you're in, you see the full gallery of everyone's photos, sorted by when they were actually taken (not when they were uploaded). Tap any photo to view it full-size, swipe through the gallery, and add captions. You can also tap the date on any photo to override it — useful for screenshots or photos without EXIF data. To contribute, tap "Add Photos," pick from your camera roll, and they upload in the background. Your photos appear in the gallery once processed.

You can join as many events as you like. They all show up on your home page.

### Member profiles

Every event shows its members at the bottom of the page. Each member's name links to their profile at `username.withme.you`. If they've made any of their events public, you'll see those listed on their profile — tap one to browse the gallery. This is how you discover other shared albums from people you know.

Only public events appear on someone's profile. Private events are never visible to anyone outside the event.

## Privacy

Fafam is built for private sharing by default:

- Events are **private** unless the host explicitly makes them public
- Your **profile page** only shows public events — nothing else is visible to the outside world
- There is no feed, no discovery, no recommendations — you only see events you've been invited to
- Photos are stored in cloud storage with access-controlled URLs that expire
- No data is sold or used for advertising

The audience is everyone from a 90-year-old grandparent to a teenager. The design prioritizes simplicity, large text, and high contrast so that nobody needs help using it.
