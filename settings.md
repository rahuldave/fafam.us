# Settings

## Your username

Your username is set when you first sign up and **cannot be changed**. It's used to sign in and as your profile URL (`username.withme.you`). Usernames must be 3–30 characters: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, starting and ending with a letter or number.

## Display name

Your display name is what other people see next to your photos and in event member lists. It's optional — if you don't set one, your username is shown instead. You can change it anytime from the Settings page.

## Signing out

Tap "Sign out" on the Settings page. You'll be logged out and returned to the login screen. To get back in, sign in with your username — we'll text a code to your phone.

## Deleting your account

You can delete your account from the Settings page. Scroll past "Sign out" and tap "Delete my account." Here's what happens:

- **Events you host** are entirely deleted — all photos (from cloud storage and the database), members, and the event itself. Gone.
- **Photos you uploaded to other people's events** that are still pending review are deleted. Photos that were already approved stay — they belong to the event now, and the host keeps them.
- **Your memberships** in other events are removed.
- **Your account** is marked as deleted. Your username stays reserved so nobody else can take it.
- **You're logged out** immediately.

### Getting your account back

If you change your mind, you can log back in with the same phone number. Your account is restored — username, display name, everything. But your hosted events and their photos are gone permanently. Deletion of content is irreversible; only the account itself can be recovered.

This also works if someone sends you an event link after you've deleted your account. Tap the link, enter your phone number, verify, and your account is restored. You'll land right in the event's join page — tap "Join Event" and you're back.

## Account suspension and bans

### Temporary suspension

Your account may be temporarily suspended if you:

- Upload photos that other members repeatedly report
- Spam events with irrelevant or excessive uploads
- Join events uninvited and behave disruptively
- Use the platform in ways that interfere with other people's experience

While suspended, you can't sign in. A suspended account can be restored by an admin if the issue is resolved.

### Permanent ban

Your account will be permanently banned for:

- Uploading pornographic, sexually explicit, or nude content
- Posting content that reveals personal information about others without consent (doxing)
- Uploading content that harasses, threatens, or targets other users
- Sharing content that exploits or endangers minors in any way
- Using the platform to distribute illegal material

A permanent ban is irreversible. When your account is permanently banned:

- **Events you host** are entirely deleted — all photos, members, and the event itself
- **Pending photos** you uploaded to other people's events are deleted
- **Approved photos** in other people's events remain — they belong to the event
- **Your memberships** in other events are removed
- **Your account is locked** — you cannot sign in again, even with the same phone number
