# Events

## Creating an event

Anyone with an account can create an event. Tap "Create Event" on the home page, give it a name, and optionally add a short description — a tagline, a vibe, whatever you want. You'll get:

- A **join link** you can text, email, or drop in a group chat
- A **QR code** you can show in person (great for weddings — print it on a table card)
- An **event code** people can type in manually

Share any of these and people can join. As host, you upload photos like everyone else — your photos appear in the gallery immediately since you're automatically trusted.

## Sharing an event

The event page has a "Share this event" card with everything you need to invite people:

- **Join link** — the full URL. Tap the copy icon to copy it to your clipboard, then paste it into a text, email, or group chat.
- **Event code** — a short code people can type in manually from the home page. Also has a copy icon.
- **QR code** — scannable by any phone camera. Great for in-person events.

Below the QR code you'll find two buttons:

- **Print** — opens a clean, printable page with the event name, date, and a large QR code. Print it and put it on a table at a wedding, tape it to a fridge at a family gathering, or hand it out at a party. People scan the QR code with their phone camera to join.
- **Share** — appears on phones and in Safari. Opens your device's native share sheet so you can send the join link via iMessage, WhatsApp, email, AirDrop, or any other app. On browsers that don't support the share sheet (like Chrome on desktop), this button is hidden — use the copy icon on the join link instead.

## Joining an event

Someone sends you a link. You tap it. If you already have an account, you'll see a "Join Event" button — tap it and you're in. If you're new, you sign up right there — phone number, text code, pick a username — and you're taken straight to the event's join page. Tap "Join Event" and you're in within a minute.

Once you're in, you see the full gallery of everyone's photos, sorted by when they were actually taken (not when they were uploaded). Tap any photo to view it full-size, swipe through the gallery, and add captions. To contribute, tap "Add Photos," pick from your camera roll, and they upload in the background. Your photos appear in the gallery once processed.

You can join as many events as you like. They all show up on your home page.

## Event name and description

The event name can be changed anytime by the host — tap the pencil icon next to it.

The description is optional and can be added or changed anytime from the event page — tap the pencil icon or the "+ Add a description…" link below the event name. It shows up on your home page, the event page, and on your public profile if the event is public. Keep it short — 300 characters max.

## Event dates

By default, an event's date on the home page and profile is determined automatically — it shows the date of the most recent photo in the event. This usually works well: a wedding event shows the wedding date, a trip event shows the last day of the trip.

If you want to set a specific date — for a future event, or to override the computed date — tap "+ Set event date" on the event page (visible to hosts only, below the description). Pick a date and time, hit Save. The event now sorts by that date on your home page and public profile.

The date picker shows the current "latest photo" date in the hint text so you know what you're overriding. To go back to automatic dating, tap the pencil icon next to the event date and hit Clear. To close without changes, hit Cancel.

Setting an event date is optional — the automatic behavior is usually better. But it's there when you need it.

## Public and private events

Events are **private** by default. Only members can see the gallery.

You can make an event **public**, which means anyone can view the gallery from your profile page at `username.withme.you` without needing an account. They can browse and see every photo, but they can't upload or interact — it's read-only. Useful for sharing wedding galleries or trip photos with people who weren't there. Toggle it on or off anytime from the event page.

## Member profiles

Every event shows its members at the bottom of the page. Each member's name links to their profile at `username.withme.you`. If they've made any of their events public, you'll see those listed on their profile — tap one to browse the gallery. This is how you discover other shared albums from people you know.

Only public events appear on someone's profile. Private events are never visible to anyone outside the event.

## Moderation

As host, you're responsible for keeping the gallery clean. Fafam gives you a moderation panel where you can:

- **Approve or remove photos** — new uploaders' photos start as "pending" until you trust them. You review and decide what makes it into the gallery.
- **Trust members** — once you trust someone, all their future uploads go straight to the gallery without review.
- **Block or kick members** — remove someone who's uploading junk, or block them from uploading entirely.
- **Rotate the join code** — if the join link gets shared too widely, rotate it. Old links stop working, you share a new one with only the people you want.

If you don't moderate, things still work — the community can report photos (two reports auto-hides a photo), and trusted members' uploads appear immediately. But for events with kids or family, active moderation keeps things comfortable for everyone.

## Downloading all photos

The host can download the entire event gallery as a ZIP file. On the event page, tap "Download All" next to the Gallery heading. Every visible photo's original file is included, named in chronological order with captions in the filename.

## Deleting an event

The host can delete an entire event from the event page. Scroll to the very bottom and tap "Delete event." This permanently removes everything: all photos (from storage and the database), all member associations, and the event itself. Every photo's original, thumbnail, and medium-size copy is deleted from cloud storage. The members' accounts are not affected — they just won't see the event on their home page anymore.

This cannot be undone. You'll be asked to confirm before anything is deleted.
