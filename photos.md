# Photos

## Uploading photos

On the event page, tap "Add Photos" and pick images from your camera roll. Photos upload directly to cloud storage, then thumbnails are generated in the background. The gallery refreshes automatically when processing is done.

You can upload up to 20 photos at a time. Duplicate photos (same image uploaded twice to the same event) are automatically detected and removed.

### Trusted vs. pending

If you're the host, your photos appear in the gallery immediately — you're automatically trusted.

If you're a guest, your photos start as **pending** until the host trusts you. While pending, only you and the host can see them. Once the host trusts you (from the moderation panel), all your future uploads go straight to the gallery.

## Viewing photos

Tap any photo in the gallery to see it full-size. Swipe left and right (or use arrow keys on desktop) to navigate through the gallery. The breadcrumb at the top shows where you are: home / event name / photo number.

## Captions

Tap the pencil icon next to "Add caption" below any photo to write a caption (up to 500 characters). Hit Save or press Enter to save. The host can edit any photo's caption. The uploader can edit their own photo's caption. Everyone else sees captions as read-only.

Captions are searchable from the gallery — use the search box above the photo grid to find photos by caption text.

## Photo dates

Photos in the gallery are sorted by when they were taken, using the date embedded in the image file (EXIF data). Most phone cameras include this automatically. If a photo has no EXIF date — screenshots, downloaded images, scanned photos — it falls back to the upload date.

You can override the date on any photo you uploaded, or on any photo in an event you host. Tap the pencil icon next to the date below the photo, pick a new date and time, and hit Save. The gallery re-sorts to reflect the change, and the event's "latest photo" date updates too.

To revert to the original date, tap the pencil again and hit Clear. If the photo had EXIF data, it goes back to that. If not, it goes back to the upload date. The hint below the date picker tells you which one it'll use. You can also hit Cancel to close the picker without making any changes.

This is useful for:
- **Screenshots or saved images** that show today's date instead of when the moment actually happened
- **Scanned prints** where you want the gallery to reflect the original date
- **Correcting wrong dates** from cameras with misconfigured clocks

## Reporting photos

If you see a photo that shouldn't be in the gallery, tap on it and hit "Report photo" at the bottom. You'll be asked to confirm, and once you do, the photo is flagged. If two different members report the same photo, it's automatically hidden from the gallery until the host reviews it. You can only report a photo once — after that, the button shows "Reported."

Reporting is anonymous to other members. Only the host can see reported photos in the moderation panel and decide whether to keep or remove them.

## Deleting photos

The host can delete any photo from their event. Open the photo, scroll down, and tap "Delete photo." The photo and all its copies (thumbnail, medium, original) are permanently removed from storage. This cannot be undone.

If you uploaded a photo and it hasn't been approved yet (still "pending"), you can also delete it yourself. Once a photo has been approved and is visible in the gallery, only the host can delete it.

## Downloading a photo

The host and the uploader can download the original photo file. On the photo view page, tap the download icon in the top-right breadcrumb area.
